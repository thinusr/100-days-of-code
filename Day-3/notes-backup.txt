Day 3

1. Conditional statements.

if / else
Depending on a particular condition the program will perform a certain action.

if condition:
	do this
else:
	do this

Take note of the indentation!

rollercoaster.py

if height > 120:
	print("You can ride the rollercoaster.")
else:
	print("Sorry, you need to grow taller")

Take note:  Code blocks and indentation.

Comparison Operators.

>	greater than
< 	less than
>= 	greater than or equal to
<=	less than or equal to
== 	equal to
!=	not equal to

2. Modulo Operator
%
Works out what is left after division.
e.g. 

10 % 5 = 0
10 % 3 = 1

3. Nesting and elif:

if condition:						<--- this must be true
	if another condition:				<--- for this to happen and this must be false
		do this
	else:						<--- for this to happen
		do this
else:
	do this

4. if / elif / else

if condition1:
	do A
elif: condition2:
	do B
else: do C

i.o.w.  If neither condition 1 or 2 is met only then go on to doing C.

5. Logical Operators.
A and B 	Both must be true
C or D		One or the other must be true
not E 		Must not be.
