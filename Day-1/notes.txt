1. Print Statement

print("Hello World!")

Hello World! = string

Check for syntax highlighting in editor and syntax errors.  Pycharm will point out errors as you code.
Check for differences in colours and error messages.

2. String Manipulation

Move to new line while in a string.  "\n"

The \n command will move to ne line.

e.g.  print("Hello World!\nHello World!\nHello World!")

will output

Hello World!
Hello World!
Hello World!

see string-maipulation.py

Concatenation / Joining

Combine two or more strings.

e.g. print("Hello " + "Thinus") = Hello Thinus
	take note of the space in "Hello "
	can also be achieved with: 

	print("Hello" + " " + "Thinus")

	or

	print("Hello" + " Thinus")

see concatenation.py

Check spaces and tabs for indentation errors.

3. Input Function

print("Hello " + input("What is your name?") + "!")

output = Hello Thinus!

see input.py

NB! Use Stack Overflow and W3 Schools for refereneces.

4. Variables

Learn to store values in containers for later use. Variables is a concept in programming that allows us to give a label to a piece of data so that we can refer or reference that data using the chosen variable name. We will see in this lesson how to create variables and how to use the variables to access the contained value.

name=input("What is your name?")

print("Hello " + name + "!")
print(len(name))

see variables.py

5. Variable Naming

Rules
- Make sure your variable names are descriptive
- Don't have spaces between words
- Don't start with numbers
- Don't use special words like print or input
- Choose simple words that are less likely to become typos
- Check the company style guidelines if you start work at a company
