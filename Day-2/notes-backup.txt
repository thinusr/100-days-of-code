Day-2

1. Data types
- Strings - any characters between quatation marks e.g. "Hello", "12345"
- Integers - whole numbers e.g. 12345
- Floats - Numbers with decimals e.g. 123.45
- Booleans - True or False - Take note always capitalised.  

Type errors will occur when wrong type is used.

Pulling out characters in a string / Subscripting

print("Hello"[0]) - Output = H
print("Hello"[4]) - Output = l
print("Hello"[-1]) - Output = o
print("Hello"[-2]) - Output = l

Integers
"12345" is a string
12345 is an integer

Floats
numbers with decimals.
123.45

Boolean
True or False


2. Type error, checking and conversions.

print(len(12345)) = wrong
print(len("12345")) = right

Len can not work with an int, only with a string.

Checking data types / Type hecking
print(type("Hello")) - output: class str
print(type(12345)) - output: class int
print(type(123.45)) - output: class float
print(type(True)) - output: class bool

Converting data types / Type conversion or Type casting
int("123") - convert string to int
print("123 + 456") - output = 123456
print(int("123") + int("456")) - output = 579

3. Mathematical Operations

+ - Addition
- - Subtraction
* - Multiplication
/ - Devision
// - Devision - Output is an integer.  Beware!  Removes decimals from non whole numbers.
** - To the power of e.g. (2**3) = 8

Remember PEMDAS

Parentheses
Exponmants
Multiplication / Division
Addition - Subtraction

4. Number Manipulation

Round
e.g.
bmi=84/1.65**2
print(bmi) output: 30.85299449035813
print(int(bmi)) output: 30
print(round(bmi)) output: 31
print(round(bmi, 2)) output: 30.85

Assignent Operators
score=0
score += 1
print(score) output: 1

print("Your score is" + str(score))

can be changed using an f-string

e.g.

score = 1
height = 1.8
is_winning = True

Take note:  Three differnt data types.

print(f"Your score is = {score}, your height is {height}. You are winning is {is_winning}.")

output:

Your score is 1, your height is 1.8.  You are winning is True.

f-string does all the convertions.

5. Tip calculator

We're going to build a tip calculator.

If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip.

Each person should pay:

see tip-calculator.py

print("Welcome to the tip calculator.")
bill = float(input("What was the total bill? "))
tip = int(input("How much tip would you like to give? 10, 12, 15? "))
multiplier = 1 + (tip / 100)
total_bill = bill * multiplier
split = input("How many people to split the bill? ")
per_person = round(total_bill / int(split), 2)
print(f"Each person should pay: ${per_person}")
